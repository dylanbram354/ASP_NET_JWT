# ASP_NET_JWT
This project implements JWT Token Authentication in an ASP.NET Web API. I created it as an exercise, hoping to gain some understanding on how to set up an application like this. I intend to use it as a starting point for future applications, since it already lays the groundwork for user registration and login.
